Due to react router implemententing breaking changes at least once a year Stephen Grider shows us that it is possible to create a faux react router out of components, useEffect hook and DOM window methods.

1. Stephen shows that window.location in the browser console will reveal a an object that has a property of pathname on it.the value for path name is accurate to the search bar in the browser.

2. see '/App-with-repeated-show.js' for details

3. Stephen then shows a repeated function;-
    const showComponent = (route, component) => {
      return window.location.pathname === route
      ? component
      : null;
    };
 but says how this isn't really an approach you should tke in react ( why not just create a component to do all the heavy lifting)
